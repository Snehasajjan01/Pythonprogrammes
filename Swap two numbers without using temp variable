# Program to swap two numbers without using a temporary variable

a = int(input("Enter first number a:"))
b = int(input("Enter second number b:"))

print("Before Swap: a =", a, "b =", b)

# Logic: use arithmetic operations
a = a + b  # a becomes 30
b = a - b  # b becomes 10 (30 - 20)
a = a - b  # a becomes 20 (30 - 10)

print("After Swap: a =", a, "b =", b)
