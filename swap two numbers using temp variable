# Program to swap two numbers using a temporary variable

a = 10

# Logic: use a temporary variable

Dynamic Code (Using Temporary Variable)
# Program to swap two numbers using a temporary variable

# Take input from user
a = int(input("Enter first number (a): "))
b = int(input("Enter second number (b): "))

print("Before Swap: a =", a, "b =", b)

# Logic: use a temporary variable
temp = a
a = b
b = temp

print("After Swap: a =", a, "b =", b)
